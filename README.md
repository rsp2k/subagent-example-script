## How Sub-Agent Orchestration Works

### 1. Parallel Analysis Phase
Multiple specialized agents analyze different aspects simultaneously:
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent 1   │  │   Agent 2   │  │   Agent 3   │
│ (Duplicates)│  │(Complexity) │  │ (Patterns)  │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
       │                 │                 │
       └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
                         │
                  ┌──────────────┐
                  │  Synthesis   │
                  │    Agent     │
                  └──────────────┘
```

### 2. Planning Phase
A synthesis agent combines findings and creates an actionable plan:
- Prioritizes issues by impact and effort
- Groups related tasks
- Identifies dependencies
- Estimates time and risk

### 3. Implementation Phase
Specialized fix agents work in parallel on approved changes:
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│  Extractor  │  │   Splitter  │  │ Standardizer│
│    Agent    │  │    Agent    │  │    Agent    │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

### 4. Verification Phase
A verification agent ensures all changes are successful:
- Runs tests after each change
- Validates behavior preservation
- Checks performance impact
- Provides rollback if needed

## Command Syntax Pattern

All commands follow a similar pattern:
```bash
command-name [target] [options]

# With aliases
@alias [target] [options]
```

Common options:
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying
- `--interactive` - Review each change
- `--auto-fix` - Apply safe fixes automatically
- `--test-command` - Custom test command
- `--backup` - Create backups (usually default)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Analysis**: Run commands in dry-run mode first
2. **Use Interactive Mode**: Review changes before applying
3. **Have Good Tests**: Ensure test coverage before major refactoring
4. **Work Incrementally**: Fix issues in small batches
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track improvements over time
6. **Customize Rules**: Define project-specific standards

## Configuration

Most commands support configuration files:

```javascript
// .techdebt.config.js
module.exports = {
  thresholds: {
    maxFileLines: 300,
    maxFunctionLines: 30,
    maxComplexity: 10
  },
  ignore: ['vendor/', 'legacy/']
};
```

## Integration

### VS Code
Add to tasks.json:
```json
{
  "label": "Find Tech Debt",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "@tech-debt-finder-fixer --dry-run"
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
code-quality:
  script:
    - @architecture-review --detect-violations
    - @tech-debt-finder-fixer --dry-run
```

### Git Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# pre-push hook
@test-gen --only-untested --coverage-target 80
```

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Approach

1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
2. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on its domain
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: No aspect is overlooked
4. **Intelligent Coordination**: Agents share findings for better decisions
5. **Safe Implementation**: Changes are verified at each step
6. **Scalable**: Can handle large codebases efficiently

## Contributing

These commands demonstrate patterns for creating your own multi-agent commands. Key principles:

1. **Clear Agent Roles**: Each agent should have a specific purpose
2. **Structured Communication**: Define clear interfaces between agents
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build complex behaviors from simple agents
4. **Safety First**: Always include verification and rollback
5. **User Control**: Provide dry-run and interactive modes
