# How to Find Technical Debt in Large Codebases

**Goal:** Systematically identify and prioritize technical debt across codebases with 1,000+ files using parallel agent analysis.

**When to use this:** You're dealing with a large, complex codebase where manual tech debt identification would take weeks, and you need comprehensive analysis with actionable priorities.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Claude Code with sub-agent commands installed
- Access to target codebase
- Sufficient computational resources (large analyses can take 10-20 minutes)

## Overview

Large codebases present unique challenges for tech debt identification:
- **Scale**: Too many files for manual review
- **Complexity**: Interconnected issues that aren't obvious in isolation  
- **Priority**: Need to focus effort on high-impact areas first
- **Risk**: Changes in large codebases can have unexpected consequences

This guide shows you how to use parallel agent analysis to systematically tackle these challenges.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

### Configure for Large Codebase Analysis

```bash
# Increase timeout for large analysis
export CLAUDE_TASK_TIMEOUT=600000  # 10 minutes

# Set up analysis workspace
mkdir tech-debt-analysis
cd tech-debt-analysis
```

### Create Analysis Configuration

Create `.techdebt.config.js` in your project root:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Focus on high-impact areas first
  includePaths: [
    'src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    'lib/**/*.{js,ts}',
    'components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    'services/**/*.{js,ts}',
    'utils/**/*.{js,ts}'
  ],
  
  // Skip generated and vendor code
  excludePaths: [
    'node_modules/**',
    'dist/**',
    'build/**',
    '*.min.js',
    '**/*.generated.*',
    'vendor/**'
  ],
  
  // Thresholds for large codebases
  thresholds: {
    maxFileLines: 250,        // Smaller threshold for large projects
    maxFunctionLines: 20,     // Stricter function limits
    maxComplexity: 8,         // Lower complexity tolerance
    duplicateThreshold: 0.8   // Higher similarity threshold
  },
  
  // Large codebase specific settings
  batchSize: 50,             // Process in smaller batches
  parallelAgents: 5,         // Use more agents for large analysis
  focusAreas: ['critical', 'high-traffic', 'error-prone']
};
```

## Step 2: Run Initial Parallel Analysis

### Launch Comprehensive Analysis

```bash
# Start with broad analysis to understand scope
@tech-debt-parallel . --type all --threshold conservative --dry-run
```

**Why dry-run first:** Large codebases can have thousands of issues. See the scope before committing to fixes.

### Interpret the Initial Results

Look for these key metrics in the output:

```
Analysis Summary:
- Files analyzed: 2,847
- Issues found: 1,204
- Critical issues: 23
- Quick wins available: 156
- Estimated total effort: 340 hours
```

**If the effort estimate is overwhelming** (>200 hours), proceed to Step 3 for focused analysis.

**If manageable** (<100 hours), skip to Step 4 for implementation planning.

## Step 3: Focus on High-Impact Areas

### Identify Critical Paths

```bash
# Analyze only critical business logic first
@tech-debt-parallel src/core src/api src/auth --type duplicates,complexity --threshold aggressive
```

### Analyze High-Traffic Areas

```bash
# Focus on user-facing components
@tech-debt-parallel src/components src/pages --type patterns,dead-code --max-changes 50
```

### Target Error-Prone Modules

```bash
# Focus on areas with frequent bugs
@tech-debt-parallel src/services src/utils --type all --fix-order risk
```

**Strategy for large codebases:** Don't try to fix everything at once. Focus on areas where improvements will have the biggest impact.

## Step 4: Use Incremental Analysis Approach

### Week 1: Critical Issues Only

```bash
@tech-debt-parallel . --type complexity --auto-fix safe --max-changes 10
```

**Focus on:** 
- Functions over 50 lines
- Files over 500 lines  
- Cyclomatic complexity > 15
- Clear duplicates with 90%+ similarity

### Week 2: High-Traffic Areas

```bash
@tech-debt-parallel src/components --type duplicates,patterns --auto-fix recommended --max-changes 15
```

**Focus on:**
- User interface components
- API endpoints
- Authentication logic
- Payment processing

### Week 3: Systematic Cleanup

```bash
@tech-debt-parallel src/utils src/helpers --type dead-code,types --auto-fix all --max-changes 20
```

**Focus on:**
- Unused utility functions
- Dead imports
- Missing type annotations
- Inconsistent patterns

## Step 5: Handle Scale-Specific Challenges

### Deal with Analysis Timeouts

If analysis times out on very large codebases:

```bash
# Analyze by directory
for dir in src/components src/services src/utils; do
  @tech-debt-parallel "$dir" --type all --max-changes 25
  sleep 60  # Let system recover between analyses
done
```

### Manage Output Volume

```bash
# Focus output on actionable items
@tech-debt-parallel . --type duplicates --threshold aggressive --fix-order quick-wins > tech-debt-report.md
```

### Coordinate Team Efforts

```bash
# Create team-specific reports
@tech-debt-parallel src/frontend --output frontend-debt.md
@tech-debt-parallel src/backend --output backend-debt.md
@tech-debt-parallel src/shared --output shared-debt.md
```

## Step 6: Prioritize Using Parallel Analysis Results

### Extract Priority Matrix

The parallel analysis provides a priority matrix. Use it to plan your approach:

```
Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort):
1. Extract common utility functions (2 hours)
2. Remove unused imports (1 hour)
3. Standardize error handling patterns (3 hours)

Major Improvements (High Impact, Medium Effort):
1. Split oversized API controllers (8 hours)
2. Consolidate duplicate validation logic (6 hours)
3. Implement consistent state management (12 hours)

Long-term Investments (Medium Impact, High Effort):
1. Refactor legacy authentication system (40 hours)
2. Modernize build pipeline (24 hours)
```

### Create Implementation Roadmap

**Sprint 1 (Week 1-2):** All quick wins + 1 major improvement
**Sprint 2 (Week 3-4):** 2 major improvements  
**Sprint 3 (Week 5-8):** 1 long-term investment

## Step 7: Track Progress and Re-analyze

### Establish Baseline Metrics

After initial analysis, record baseline metrics:

```bash
@tech-debt-parallel . --dry-run --output baseline-report.md
```

Key metrics to track:
- Total issues count
- Critical issues count  
- Average file size
- Average function complexity
- Duplicate code percentage

### Re-analyze After Improvements

```bash
# After each sprint, re-analyze to measure progress
@tech-debt-parallel . --dry-run --output progress-report-week-N.md
```

### Compare Results

```bash
# Generate progress comparison
diff baseline-report.md progress-report-week-4.md > improvement-summary.md
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Analysis Takes Too Long

**Solution:** Use staged analysis approach:

```bash
# Stage 1: Quick overview
@tech-debt-parallel . --type duplicates --threshold conservative --max-changes 0

# Stage 2: Detailed analysis of problem areas only
@tech-debt-parallel src/problematic-module --type all --threshold aggressive
```

### Challenge: Too Many Issues to Address

**Solution:** Focus on technical debt that blocks other work:

```bash
# Find debt that prevents testing
@tech-debt-parallel . --type complexity,patterns --context testing

# Find debt that blocks refactoring
@tech-debt-parallel . --type duplicates,dead-code --context refactoring
```

### Challenge: Team Coordination Issues

**Solution:** Use parallel analysis to create focused team assignments:

```bash
# Frontend team responsibilities
@tech-debt-parallel src/components src/pages --assignee frontend-team

# Backend team responsibilities  
@tech-debt-parallel src/api src/services --assignee backend-team

# Shared responsibilities
@tech-debt-parallel src/utils src/types --assignee architecture-team
```

### Challenge: Resistance to Large-Scale Changes

**Solution:** Start with automated, safe improvements:

```bash
# Begin with safest changes that can be automated
@tech-debt-parallel . --auto-fix safe --type dead-code,imports --dry-run

# Show the impact of safe changes before proposing risky ones
```

## Success Metrics
