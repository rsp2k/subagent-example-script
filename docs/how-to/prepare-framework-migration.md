# How to Prepare for Framework Migrations

**Goal:** Use parallel agent analysis to systematically prepare your codebase for major framework migrations, reducing risk and ensuring smooth transitions.

**When to use this:** You're planning to migrate to a new framework version (React 17→18, Laravel 8→10, etc.) or completely different technology and need comprehensive preparation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Target codebase ready for analysis
- Clear understanding of migration destination
- Time to implement recommended preparations (typically 1-4 weeks)

## Migration Preparation Strategy

Framework migrations are high-risk, high-reward activities. Parallel agent analysis helps by:
- **Identifying blockers** before you start migrating
- **Reducing technical debt** that complicates migrations  
- **Creating migration roadmap** with realistic timelines
- **Establishing rollback procedures** for safety

## Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis

### Run Comprehensive Tech Debt Analysis

```bash
# Identify issues that will complicate migration
@tech-debt-parallel . --type all --context migration-prep
```

**Focus areas for migration prep:**
- **Deprecated API usage**: Will break in new framework versions
- **Tight coupling**: Makes incremental migration difficult
- **Missing tests**: Essential for validating migration success
- **Complex components**: Need simplification before migration

### Analyze Current Architecture

```bash
# Understand current architecture before changing it
@arch-review . --detect-violations --suggest-improvements --output architecture-baseline.md
```

**Key insights needed:**
- **Dependency relationships**: What depends on what
- **Layer violations**: Will new framework expose architectural issues?
- **Coupling points**: Where framework changes will have biggest impact
- **Test coverage gaps**: Critical areas without validation

## Step 2: Framework-Specific Preparation

### React Migration Preparation

```bash
# For React 16→17→18 migrations
@migrate --from react@16 --to react@18 --compatibility-check --dry-run
```

**Common preparation tasks:**
- Replace deprecated lifecycle methods
- Update to function components and hooks
- Remove unsafe patterns (findDOMNode, string refs)
- Update testing patterns for new rendering behavior

### Laravel Migration Preparation

```bash
# For Laravel version upgrades
@migrate --from laravel@8 --to laravel@10 --incremental --rollback-plan
```

**Common preparation tasks:**
- Update deprecated Eloquent patterns
- Modernize route definitions
- Update middleware patterns
- Prepare for new validation syntax

### JavaScript to TypeScript Migration

```bash
# Special case: language migration
@migrate --pattern js-to-ts --incremental --type-strategy gradual
```

**Preparation strategy:**
- Start with configuration files
- Add types to utility functions first
- Gradually type component interfaces
- Leave complex business logic for last

## Step 3: Create Migration-Ready Architecture

### Simplify Before Migrating

**Principle:** Don't migrate complex, problematic code. Fix it first, then migrate.

```bash
# Reduce complexity before migration
@refactor . --type reduce-complexity --max-complexity 8 --create-shared
```

**Target improvements:**
- **Extract utilities**: Move business logic out of framework-specific code
- **Simplify components**: Break down large, complex components
- **Standardize patterns**: Ensure consistent code patterns throughout
- **Remove dead code**: Don't migrate code you don't need

### Establish Testing Foundation

```bash
# Ensure comprehensive test coverage before migration
@test-gen . --coverage-target 85 --type unit,integration --update-existing
```

**Critical testing areas:**
- **Core business logic**: Must work exactly the same after migration
- **Integration points**: API calls, database interactions, external services
- **User workflows**: End-to-end scenarios that users depend on
- **Error handling**: Edge cases and failure scenarios

### Decouple Framework Dependencies

```bash
# Identify and reduce framework coupling
@arch-review . --style hexagonal --detect-violations
```

**Decoupling strategies:**
- **Extract domain logic**: Move business rules out of framework code
- **Use adapter patterns**: Isolate framework-specific code
- **Standardize interfaces**: Create consistent APIs between layers
- **Minimize framework surface area**: Limit framework usage to specific layers

## Step 4: Create Migration Plan

### Analyze Migration Complexity

```bash
# Get detailed migration assessment
@migrate --from current-framework --to target-framework --analysis-only --output migration-plan.md
```

**Migration plan should include:**
- **Phase breakdown**: Which parts to migrate in which order
- **Dependency order**: What must be migrated before what
- **Risk assessment**: High-risk areas requiring extra attention
- **Rollback procedures**: How to undo each phase if needed

### Estimate Migration Effort

**Use parallel analysis to create realistic estimates:**

```
Phase 1: Configuration and tooling (Week 1)
- Update build configuration
- Migrate development dependencies
- Update CI/CD pipeline

Phase 2: Core utilities and shared code (Week 2)
- Migrate utility functions
- Update shared components
- Migrate common services

Phase 3: Feature-by-feature migration (Weeks 3-6)
- Migrate one feature per week
- Full testing after each feature
- Monitor for regressions

Phase 4: Final cleanup and optimization (Week 7)
- Remove old framework dependencies
- Optimize for new framework patterns
- Performance testing and tuning
```

## Step 5: Execute Pre-Migration Improvements

### Address Critical Issues First

**Priority order based on migration impact:**

1. **Blockers**: Issues that prevent migration
   ```bash
   @tech-debt-parallel . --type compatibility --severity critical
   ```

2. **High-risk areas**: Complex code that could break during migration
   ```bash
   @refactor src/complex-modules/ --type extract-method --max-complexity 5
   ```

3. **Missing tests**: Areas without adequate coverage
   ```bash
   @test-gen src/critical-features/ --type unit,integration --coverage-target 90
   ```

4. **Technical debt**: Issues that will complicate migration
   ```bash
   @tech-debt-parallel . --type duplicates,dead-code --auto-fix safe
   ```

### Implement in Migration-Friendly Order

**Recommended sequence:**

```bash
# Week 1: Foundation
@tech-debt-parallel ./config ./build --auto-fix all
@test-gen ./src/utils ./src/shared --coverage-target 95

# Week 2: Core services
@refactor ./src/services --type extract-method --create-shared
@test-gen ./src/services --type integration --coverage-target 90

# Week 3: Components and features  
@refactor ./src/components --type extract-component --max-component-size 200
@test-gen ./src/components --type unit --coverage-target 85

# Week 4: Integration and validation
@arch-review . --detect-violations
@test-gen . --type e2e --coverage-target 80
```

## Step 6: Validate Migration Readiness

### Run Final Pre-Migration Analysis

```bash
# Comprehensive readiness check
@tech-debt-parallel . --type all --threshold conservative --output migration-readiness.md
```

**Readiness criteria:**
- ✅ **Zero critical issues** that would block migration
- ✅ **Test coverage >80%** for all core functionality  
- ✅ **Complexity metrics** within acceptable ranges
- ✅ **Architecture violations** resolved
- ✅ **Migration plan** validated and approved

### Create Migration Monitoring Plan

```bash
# Establish baseline metrics for comparison
@perf-optimize . --baseline pre-migration-baseline.json
@arch-review . --output pre-migration-architecture.md
```

**Metrics to track during migration:**
- **Performance**: Load times, response times, memory usage
- **Functionality**: All tests continue passing
- **Architecture**: No new violations introduced
- **User experience**: No regression in user workflows

## Common Migration Patterns

### Big Bang vs. Incremental

**Big Bang Migration:**
- Migrate entire codebase at once
- Higher risk but faster completion
- Best for smaller codebases (<10,000 lines)
- Requires comprehensive preparation

**Incremental Migration:**
- Migrate piece by piece
- Lower risk, longer timeline
- Best for larger codebases (>10,000 lines)  
- Allows learning and adjustment

### Framework-Specific Considerations

**React Migrations:**
```bash
# Check for React-specific issues
@migrate --from react@17 --to react@18 --check-strict-mode --check-suspense
```

**Laravel Migrations:**
```bash
# Check for Laravel-specific deprecations
@migrate --from laravel@8 --to laravel@9 --check-helpers --check-eloquent
```

**Vue Migrations:**
```bash
# Check for Vue-specific patterns
@migrate --from vue@2 --to vue@3 --check-composition-api --check-filters
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

**Compatibility issues:**
- Run compatibility analysis early: `@migrate --compatibility-check`
- Create isolated testing environments
- Maintain detailed rollback procedures

**Performance regressions:**
- Establish performance baselines: `@perf-optimize --baseline`
- Monitor key metrics during migration
- Have performance rollback triggers defined

**Functionality breaks:**
- Achieve high test coverage before starting
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain parallel systems during transition

### Project Risks

**Timeline overruns:**
- Use realistic estimates from parallel analysis
- Include buffer time for unexpected issues
- Plan incremental delivery to show progress

**Team disruption:**
- Train team on new framework before migration
- Assign framework champions to help others
- Document new patterns and best practices

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success

- **Zero critical bugs** introduced during migration
- **Performance maintained or improved** compared to baseline
- **Test coverage maintained** at pre-migration levels
- **Architecture quality improved** through migration

### Project Success

- **Migration completed** within estimated timeline
- **Team productivity** returns to normal within 2 weeks
- **User satisfaction** maintained throughout transition
- **Future development velocity** improved by framework upgrade

## Post-Migration Cleanup

```bash
# After successful migration
@tech-debt-parallel . --type legacy-patterns --auto-fix recommended
@arch-review . --suggest-improvements --compare pre-migration-architecture.md
@perf-optimize . --compare pre-migration-baseline.json
```

**Cleanup activities:**
- Remove old framework dependencies
- Update documentation and README
- Optimize for new framework patterns
- Share lessons learned with team

## When Migration Goes Wrong

### Early Warning Signs

- **Tests failing** during preparation phase
- **Performance degrading** in test environments
- **Team struggling** with new framework concepts
- **Timeline slipping** consistently

### Recovery Strategies

```bash
# Quick assessment if migration is struggling
@migrate --rollback-assessment --risk-analysis
```

**Options when struggling:**
1. **Pause and address issues**: Fix problems before continuing
2. **Simplify scope**: Migrate less complex parts first
3. **Get help**: Bring in framework experts
4. **Consider alternatives**: Maybe migration isn't the right choice

## Next Steps

**If migration preparation is successful:**
- Proceed with planned migration timeline
- Monitor metrics closely during execution
- Be prepared to pause if issues arise

**If preparation reveals significant issues:**
- Address critical problems before migrating
- Consider extending preparation timeline
- Reevaluate migration necessity and timing
