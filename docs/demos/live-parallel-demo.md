### **Cross-Agent Intelligence Examples**

```bash
🧠 SYNTHESIS INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔗 Smart Correlation #1:
Agent 1.1 found: "ProductCard component duplicated 3 times"
Agent 1.2 found: "ProductCard has complexity score of 23"
Agent 1.3 found: "ProductCard uses 4 different prop naming patterns"

💡 Synthesis Insight: "High complexity stems from duplicated logic 
   with inconsistent patterns. Consolidating into single, well-designed 
   component will simultaneously fix complexity, duplication, and 
   pattern issues."

🔗 Smart Correlation #2:  
Agent 1.4 found: "unused validateEmail function in utils/"
Agent 1.1 found: "email validation logic duplicated in 3 components"
Agent 1.5 found: "email validation missing TypeScript types"

💡 Synthesis Insight: "Components reimplemented email validation 
   because existing util was untyped. Adding types to validateEmail 
   and promoting its usage will eliminate 3 duplications."
```

### **Resource Utilization**

```bash
RESOURCE EFFICIENCY COMPARISON:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Sequential Approach:
CPU Usage:  [████    ] 25% (1 core active, 3 idle)
Memory:     [███     ] 180MB peak
Efficiency: Poor - 75% of resources unused

Parallel Approach:  
CPU Usage:  [████████] 85% (3.2 cores active)
Memory:     [██████  ] 340MB peak  
Efficiency: Excellent - optimal resource utilization

💡 Parallel execution provides 3.4x better resource utilization
